                  <h3 class="header1">Naked</h3>
              <div>Purest and most innocent conversations occurs between two naked souls, where you don’t need words to express and make anything clear. The silent conversations between the eyes and the bodies do the most of the talking that aren’t enough conveyed by words.<br>
                 Making a conversation with words is sometimes difficult but once you understand that these needless words doesn’t replicated what you actually wanted them to understand. We sometimes just need the silence to make ourselves ready and understand what others wanted to say and hear them from beneath. <br>
                 One night lying over him I realized the peace everyone talks about while praying in different religious stations. That night our eyes read everything that we couldn’t express and didn’t found the courage to fit it in words. We were silent, but our emotions were dancing and celebrating together the numerous ups and downs, falling and standing up together, we have reached the position where none of this matter enough to think. Our lips were smiling that to me was worth a million and are placed over everything that others can touch and buy, I can’t endure anything more pleasing than his smile on that athletic face.<br>
                 We were sleeping but our little conversations are countinously running in our hearts, talking furiously and complaining about the mistakes we made unknowingly and was trying to explain to give us some time we needed when everything seems to be fine but it isn’t. 
                 But we were happy and smiling while being there at the moment.  <br>

                <h3 class="header3">Come Back</h3>      
              <div>I remembered the last time you rescued me.<br>
                     <br>                                 
                     But I never thought I needed any help. I was spending my days drinking the beers, binging on Netflix and listening my best friends about how many ways he was wrong for me. That I didn’t deserved him, I certainly liked their ways in which they tried to make me feel better with their words. And my nights were awesome roaming in the streetlights and laughing in the couples sitting in the café. I didn’t give damn at those people who wanted me to leave all this behind and was suggesting me to go to my family. How could I go like a stubborn child, and tell them I ran away from my problems, and cry on their laps.<br>
                      <br>
                     I had already made my mind to never cry, make myself strong in the morning and think about the other stuffs to ignore any chance to remember him, but always ended with the tears in my eyes and the wet pillow, which was always hidden away from my besties too
                     .. Being a total jerk, when I met Aarush in the supermarket it didn’t make anything change. But that accidental collision wasn’t that accidental. Was it secretly planned by him? Or by me? Or by them sitting up there seeing us all making mistakes and wanting us to take the next step until we reach the destination. We hit each other hard enough to fall over each other. And for a sec I didn’t wanted to get up, but we did. .
                     I am grateful that we met. You were that last pile of unread book that never meant to be read and thrown away. Your presence was that smell of fresh coffee, that woke me up from the aimlessly life. I never thought that someone will ever make me the best of myself. Aarush you were the last person I have trusted. You always understood the words that never dared to came out of my mind, instead you sitting on the couch made me face my own thoughts. You pushed me to the extreme shore and made an unwavering stone.<br>
                      <br>
                      One day you just left. Unsaid. No goodbyes, no note to make me remember to take care of myself. Just left, maybe without any destination. .<br>
                     But I am losing myself again.<br>
                    I need you one more time….❤<br>
